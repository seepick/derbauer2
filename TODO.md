# Todo

==> FOCUS: test properly; fix all major bugs; release <==

## Now

* !!! UI: emoji v-space issue!
* BZ: citizens
* BZ: go through derbauer/doc info

## Next

* BZ: general variability end turn (production, consumption)
* cheat mode (press secret key, increase resources)
* BZ: tech enabler
* IT: ci/cd
* IT: coverage
* IT: detekt
* IT: sonarqube cloud
* IT: automated releases
* BZ: random events
* UI: bright/dark mode support

## Later

* sound: continuous bg music; press key beep; each age different theme?!
  * how to configure? overlay menu?!
* font styling: <red> <green> <bold> etc.
  * like ctrl-codes in shell; process in renderer and remember positions and style for compose annotations

## Ideas

* UI: overlay info notifier/window/toast; e.g. not enough resources to buy, etc. (or keep it simple?)
* UI: colored text? (build annotated string necessary for compose text...)
* UI: set icon in Dock (iconFile in build.gradle)
* UI: set icon of window
