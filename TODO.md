# Todo

==> FOCUS: test properly; fix all major bugs; release <==

## Now

* change SPACE to ENTER for back&continue
* BZ: citizens: houses, birth, food consumption, gold taxes
* BZ: go through derbauer/doc info
* BZ: feature enabler

## Next

* UI: predictable order of entities/resources (give each a weight??)
* ! IT: ci/cd
* BZ: general variability end turn (production, taxes, consumption)
* IT: detekt
* BZ: random events
* UI: bright/dark mode support

## Later

* IT: sonarqube cloud
* IT: coverage
* IT: automated releases
* cheat mode (press secret key, increase resources)
* sound: continuous bg music; press key beep; each age different theme?!
  * how to configure? overlay menu?!
* font styling: <red> <green> <bold> etc.
  * like ctrl-codes in shell; process in renderer and remember positions and style for compose annotations

## Ideas

* UI: overlay info notifier/window/toast; e.g. not enough resources to buy, etc. (or keep it simple?)
* UI: colored text? (build annotated string necessary for compose text...)
* UI: set icon in Dock (iconFile in build.gradle)
* UI: set icon of window
