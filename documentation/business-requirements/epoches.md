# Epochs / Ages

* the game is divided into phases, each with focus on different aspects
    * this is steered by the features enabled/disabled and algorithmic mechanics used
    * some parts will run out, some easy to produce, ... this way influence user's behavior/strategy/focus
* give them fancy names, like age of empires; bronze age, renessaince, ...
