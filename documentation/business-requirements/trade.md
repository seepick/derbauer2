# Trade

* each resource can be bought/sold for gold
  * the buy is always more expensive than sell
* only limited amount of resources to buy
  * each turn refreshes gradually to given max
  * max is determined by...? 

# Tradable stuff

in the beginning, only food is tradable. the rest unlocks later.

* food
    - very poor sell
* land
    - only buy, very expensive
    - will get gradually more expensive (slightly more than linear growth)
      - intention: push user to switch to military (next epoch)
* armies
    - high requirements (buildings, upgrades, achievements)
    - very expensive

## Ideas

* price changes for each interaction
  - buying much: higher buy price
  - selling much: lower sell price
* trade is related to the term "marketplace" (a new building?!)
    - faster "regeneration" (more to buy/sell)
    - better prices (far not as much as achievement though)
