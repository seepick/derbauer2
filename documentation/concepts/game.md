# Game

General game concepts...

* TITLES: progress will be rewarded with "better sounding" designators
  * examples:
    * user: lord -> king -> emperor -> ...
    * city (based on citizen, and maybe bit more): village -> town -> city -> ...
  * calculation based on overarching stat (called "stars" for now)
  * it can also degrade again
