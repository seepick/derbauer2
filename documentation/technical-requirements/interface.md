# Interface

## Prompt

* select options by number
  * max 9 items (1-9); needs runtime check as options are generated dynamically :-/
  * IDEA: possibility to "[0] next page" if more than 9 options? (either dynamically created, or manually constructed/grouped)
* allow for free numbers entered (including magnituted suffix to enable "123k")
* NO: use arrow up/down
* NO: mouse support (max. for tooltips; maybe for sound controls later)
