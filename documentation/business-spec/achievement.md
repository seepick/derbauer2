# Achievement

* about / essence:
    * a progression based happening
    * some kind of "XP reward"
    * similar to feature/tech maybe
    * relies on historical data
* get free stuff with it (otherwise just a meaningless cosmetic)
    * gold/food/land/buildings (if sufficient storage/land available)

## Triggered by

* resources: total produced/owned
* buildings: total build/owned
* trades: buy/sell amount, money spent/earned
    * e.g. when traded x-times, then get reward as in achievement being the ~"capitalism guru"
* military armies: total hired/owned
* attacks: attack VS raid, won/lost/total
* happenings: good vs bad
* days (each week, month, year), give special reward
* ui-interation ;) e.g. having entered the build menu x-times
* ... differentiate between: by type VS global
