# Epoch

* synonym: age, era, period, phase (like in age of empires)
* the game is divided into phases, each with focus on different aspects
    * this is steered by the features enabled/disabled and algorithmic mechanics used
    * some parts will run out, some easy to produce, ... this way influence user's behavior/strategy/focus
* give them fancy names: bronze age, renessaince, ...
* in earl stage of game, food is the main thing
    - later on, gold
    - later later on, land as buildings require lots of land
    - push user to get more involved in military actions (as trading is highly expensive)
* IDEA: for each, a different color theme used by rendering engine (ascii arts different? emojis?)
