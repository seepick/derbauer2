# Stats

* about:
    * the kingdom/population can be in certain "states", qualities/dimensions applicable globally
        * e.g. happiness, wealth, health, karma, ...
* indicating how it's doing, good/bad
* affected by:
    * dynamic computation (which makes it different from features)
    * buildings, features, decisions made

* effects:
    * any random calculation...
    * growth/production/consumption, prices/trading rates, battle outcomes, etc.
    * some kind of "luck", effecting various game mechanics; happenings (pos/neg nature)
* NO: it's not like a resource! it can be negative; it's not a physical object (not an Asset)
    * yet it will be affected similarly to a resource; "consumed/produced"?

* Affected by:
    * each entity; buildings, resources, armies, tech, other stats ... owned&enabled.
    * especially some "XP" like tracker (idea with Interaction concept), how often done certain things
