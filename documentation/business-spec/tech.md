# Technology

* just a conventional tech-tree, enabling permanent [features](feature.md); aka "research"
* attributes:
    * costs: (mostly) knowledge, gold, ... maybe other resources too?
        * prerequisites: other technology, buildings (military strength, resources?), ...
            * type: singular | leveled (reserchable multiple times, increasing costs; maybe infinitely like factorio?)
* PS: no need for concept of "upgrades", tech-tree will do it together with Features concept

## Effects

* new possibities/features
    * new buildings/features/actions (type == singular)
    * menu items (new things to do), buildings, happenings, resources, ...
* economy:
    * resource production/capacity (effectiveness/efficiency of buildings; type == leveled)
    * lower build/maintanance costs (type == leveled)
    * better trade prices (type == leveled)
* trade: prices, amounts, regeneration
* miliatry: unlock new army types, price, army strengths/stats (att/def), globally or by army
* social/civic: better stats (happiness, growth rate, ...)

## Knowledge

* a.k.a. tech/science/research points
* to research tech, spent costs (like gold for buildings)
* produced in tech-buildings (school, university, laboratory)
    * improveable via tech itself

## Example Tree

* Agriculture
    * Irrigation
    * Food Preservation: +storage capacity
* Religion
* Capitalism: advanced trading
* Warfare: enables military
* Medicine: improve health stat; fewer diseases
* Education: increase knowledge production
