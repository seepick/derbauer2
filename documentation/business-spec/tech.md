# Technology

* just a conventional tech-tree, enabling permanent [features](feature.md); aka "research"
* attributes:
    * costs: (mostly) knowledge; maybe other resources too (?)
    * prerequisites: other technology, buildings (military strength, resources?), ...
        * type: singular | leveled (reserchable multiple times, increasing costs; maybe infinitely like factorio?)
* Knowledge, a.k.a. science/research points
    * produced in tech-buildings; improveable via tech itself
* PS: no need for concept of "upgrades", tech-tree will do it together with Features concept

## Effects

* new possibities/features
    * new buildings/features/actions (type == singular)
    * menu items (new things to do), buildings, happenings, resources, ...
* economy:
    * resource production/capacity (effectiveness/efficiency of buildings; type == leveled)
    * lower build/maintanance costs (type == leveled)
    * better trade prices (type == leveled)
* trade: prices, amounts, regeneration
* miliatry: unlock new army types, price, army strengths/stats (att/def), globally or by army
* social/civic: better stats (happiness, growth rate, ...)

## Examples

* AdvancedAgriculture
* AdvancedTrading
* Religion
* ImprovedStorage
* MilitaryTactics
* TradeRoutes
* ConstructionTechniques
* HappinessInitiatives
* DivineFavor
* a name for an example which increases food storage would be: "ImprovedStorage", "EnhancedGranaries", "
  FoodPreservationTechniques", "AdvancedStorageSolutions", "EfficientFoodManagement", or "OptimizedGranarySystems", or "
  FoodStorageInnovation", or "GranaryEnhancementTech"
