# Story

* you are a king of a kingdom
* it is europe in the middle ages
* your goal is to expand your kingdom

# User Motivation

* discover/enable new features (build, army, actions, minigames,...)
    * how about achievements? maybe highscore?
* start small, grow big
    * the UI is almost empty at first; gradually introduce new game features/mechanics/menus/etc.
    * sparkle curiosity to interact with the game, and earn new "things" as a reward

# Guiding Flavors

* favor interconnectedness
    * everything affects everything
    * every decision has consequences (will be remembered)
* less is more
    * fewer choices, keep it simple (not overwhelm); progress interaction buildup (features unlocked)
    * hide complexity; concepts invisible to player

# Style

* Medieval theme, language more fun (theatralic, fun zynism, old english style)
