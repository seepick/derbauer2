# Resource Types

* Simple: Gold, Food, Wood, Stone, Knowledge, ...
* Complex: Land, People, ...

## People

* needs storage (houses), thus have capacity
* if over limit, then lose gradually
* affected by state happyness: do something "nice" for people
* produce gold via taxes
    * income influenced by features/achievements
* consume food
* reproduce themselves via production rate (depends on happyness and food availability)
* spent for armies
* get via random events (happenings) depending on karma (and amount on wealth)
    * imigrants move in (if happy, enough housing, enough food)
* might trade via slavery feature (less happyness)
* ?? are used for buildings, kind of "upcome"??

* mainly via people (tax rate)
    - modifiers: number of people + happyness
    - influenced by certain buildings/technologies/features
    - wealth "somehow" is relevant
* upcome costs/maintenance (buildings/armies)
* it's not possible to get negative balance (only if contract exists with bank?)
    * if in minus (without bank contract): in end turn resources/buildings immediately gone until in positive again?
* IDEA: maybe (???) production possible (via mines)?
