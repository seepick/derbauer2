# Out of Scope

* The **graveyard** of ideas (and also to set a healthy limit/scope, thus gaining focus/clarity).
* Maybe next time:
    * each unit by itself; e.g. has individual HP, can level up, gain experience, ...
* Unrealistic, for sure NOT:
    * multiplayer via network
    * time-based (each 1sec = 1 tick)
    * 2D/3D graphics
