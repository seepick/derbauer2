# Misc Business Ideas

* text-to-speech :)
* increase designators (title, city) based on "some criteria"
    * can be upped and lowered again! different than feature, which is a one-way unlock
* immigration happening (only if citizen usage < 80%); if karma high
* (rat&gold) happening amount with probability range { lil=5%, med=10%, big=20% } + diffuser; limitted
    * base value = 10% of all time max resource; round to 10s/100s/...
* cheat mode (press secret key, adjust resources, add/remove entities; deeper debug insights)
* market adjustment: when selling too much, price drops; recovers over time to baseline
* add stats.happy + game renderer/resource info bar: add happy indicator: "12/20 🙎🏻‍♂️☹️"
* probability (happening) cool-down mechanism to avoid same thing too often
* ad history, if Reports would be outside of User, then could take deepCopies of user and store them

Low:

* maybe Land is of type "OccupiableResource"; more generic; reusable for other potential future resources
* FeatureTurner
    * TX-exec one, could later allow another to check==true
    * thus: do rounds of applying, until no feature returns check==true anymore
    * e.g.: TradingFeature enables TradeLandFeature; should BOTH appear in turn screens
* once stats are implemented, then let junkfood-tech also increase happiness
* let AI generate doc, based on code (before that, align documents with package structure)
* ad TradingFeature check logic: look for turns played (and/or money owned?)
* reverse engineer DerBauer1
* decisions impact story, influence
* improve found-gold-happening: consider history, gold amount (max, current, avg over last x-turns), etc.
* AD turn citizen: if too little food (not 0 though) for >1 round, slowly starve
    * currently only starve if 0 food
* attack barbarians, or NPCs

## Concepts

* Supply Chain and Logistics (factorio)
    * buildings consume to produce other (higher) resources; respect ratio
* Financial System
    * allows to adjust tax rate (gold/happiness tradeoff)
* Banking
    * allows finanicial actions (borrow/invest money, ...)
* Religion
    * atheism, monotheism, polytheism; mixed allowed
    * effects: happiness, production, military, ...
* Policy: change laws
    - taxes (gambling, banking, land, military)
    - +gold prod; -happyness/people prod
    - feature enabled when ... upgrade "politics" + building "tax office"
* Diplomacy
    * mit verschiedene voelker, relationship metrik
    * actions: buy/sell troops, handeln/schenken/verlangen, buendnis, ...
    * other nations: info about resources, army, ....
        - diplomacy, spy, war
        - trade agreement, send gift, hire troops, alliance
        - happening: get free stuff from other; get requested to donate/help/escort (borrow miliatry units)
* Management (automation)
    * hire manager delegate, which will for example: auto trade sell food if capacity at 80%
